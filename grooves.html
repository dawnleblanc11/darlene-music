        <a>During their “funky” years, the Bar-Kays, an American rhythm and blues, soul, and funk band, composed an excellent perspective song titled “Attitude.”  What is a perspective song?  It’s a song that may make you get up and bop, but the words will stay with you. Here are just a few lines of that song’s lyrics.
        Your attitude is what describes you. What you want to be. 
        It just may not be what the people see.
        It’s up to your attitude to show the real you.  
        Because it’s in your eyes; that’s where the truth resides.
        Here come the changes!
        “Your attitude is what describes you.” An unusual but quite memorable hook. Nothing truly reveals your attitude louder than your actions along with your words. That said, how a person feels may be completely different then their actions portray. Just because someone does or says nice things doesn’t necessarily mean they are a nice person. Today’s message from God’s Word demonstrates how some early Christians didn’t feel their attitudes had any connection to their Christian walk.
